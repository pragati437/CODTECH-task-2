OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

This project implements three fundamental data structures in C++: Linked List, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Graph. Each data structure includes standard operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. Below is a brief description of each data structure and its functionalities:

1. Linked List
   - Node Structure: Each node contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
   - Operations:
     - Insertion: Adds a new node with a specified value at the end of the list.
     - Deletion: Removes the first node that contains the specified value.
     - Traversal: Prints all the elements of the list in sequence.
     - Searching: Checks if a given value exists in the list.
   - Memory Management: The destructor frees the memory allocated for the list.

 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - Node Structure: Each node contains an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.
   - Operations:
     - Insertion: Adds a new node with a specified value, maintaining BST properties.
     - Deletion: Removes a node with the specified value and rebalances the tree.
     - Inorder Traversal: Prints the elements of the BST in sorted order.
     - Searching: Checks if a given value exists in the BST.
   - Memory Management: The destructor recursively deletes all nodes in the tree.

 3. Graph
   - Structure: Represented as an adjacency list where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices.
   - Operations:
     - Add Edge: Connects two vertices in the graph (undirected).
     - DFS Traversal: Depth-First Search traversal of the graph starting from a given vertex.
     - BFS Traversal: Breadth-First Search traversal of the graph starting from a given vertex.
     - Search using DFS: Checks if a target vertex is reachable from a given starting vertex using DFS.

Main Function
   - Demonstrates the usage of each data structure by performing a series of operations and displaying the results.
